# Multiplayer Vessel Crew Game

(a.k.a. FTL but its a multiplayer browser game)

## Concept

It's like FTL but you play as a crew member. Guns of Icarus / Sea of Theives, but 2D/2.5D and you can play in your browser.

Might be set in space, but that trope is quickly becoming cliche. A fantasy airship sim might be fun.

## The Plan

We'll approach this project in stages:

Stage 1:
- Bring ourselves up-to-speed in the language.
- Assess toolchain candidates. Make a toy game from a tutorial in each toolchain you're assessing. Compare the dev experience. Decide on a toolchain.
- Iterate a proof-of-concept for this game. This may require developing intermediate proofs of concept.

Stage 1 ends when we have a playable proof-of-concept in hand, created using the toolchain we will use for the remainder of the project.

Stage 2:
- Sketch the user model and networking flowchart.
- Formalize the game's design document.
- Assess operational costs and business model.
- Distill the design document into a technical specification for Alpha 1.
- Draft and review contracts, if applicable.

Stage 2 ends when we have marching orders for developing the first alpha build, and our bases are covered, legally speaking.

Stage 3: develop the alpha.
