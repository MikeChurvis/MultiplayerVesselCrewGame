# Multiplayer Vessel Crew Game

(a.k.a. FTL but its an MMO browser game)

## Concept

It's like FTL but you play as a crew member.

Might be set in space, but that trope is quickly becoming cliche. A fantasy airship sim might be fun.

## Architecture

There will be browser clients that connect to a web server. Beyond this, I do not yet know.

## Musings

I haven't touched game development since 2016. I worked with Unity (C#) back then. In the time since, my entire coding ecosystem has changed; my languages now are Python and Typescript (though I will happily learn Rust if this game demands it), and my wheelhouse is the full stack of web tech. I have much to learn, unlearn, and relearn.
