## Musings

> I haven't touched game development since 2016. I worked with Unity (C#) back then. In the time since, my entire coding ecosystem has changed; my languages now are Python and Typescript (though I will happily learn Rust if this game demands it), and my wheelhouse is full-stack web. I have much to learn, unlearn, and relearn.
